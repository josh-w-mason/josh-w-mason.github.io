	<h1 class='blog-head'>Neuroplasticity</h1><br><br>

	<p class='blog-para'><span class='blog-question'> - Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</span><br><br>
    At it’s core the idea is harnessing the sense of optimism that can come from believing in things being able to change. If you fundamentally know that it’s possible to actually alter your mind – not just change an opinion or update a belief, but literally change the physical structure of your brain – it eradicates the possibility of a sort of cognitive defeatism. We all understand how this works physiologically. I doubt there are many people out there who look at some really physically fit celebrity and go “well, because I wasn’t born with that body type, I’ll never be able to run that fast / swim that far etc”. True, our genes provide a starting physical template, which can vary in height, width, proportion and so on, but we all understand that if you want to attain some goal like running a marathon you just run a bit each day, and increase the distance each time.
    <br><br> What can be tricky is transposing this to the psychological. A tangible, easily measured external goal is one thing, but how do you say “I want to be a more compassionate person”? It is possible in the same way, through strengthening neural pathways and dedicated practise, but you have to do a lot more detective work in discovering  all the complicated mental habits, emotional predispositions etc and how they interact with one another. The benefits are that you can become more competent and capable if you know it’s actually possible through effort, rather than seeing things as static and being like “some people are just born smarter and therefore do better in life and that’s that”

    Sometimes I think to myself “are there thought patterns that could be detrimental, that I’ve just unconsciously reinforced over the years, that are just so hard to imagine any other way? How would I even recognise such things if they have become part of the furniture?”
The very act of me being on this course is a good example of finding and challenging and going about conscience rewiring. Programming I previously lumped in the box “too hard - that’s for math oriented savants and not for idealistic arty brain types like me”. If you essentialize and stereotype you can close doors unnecessarily, i.e “I’m X type of person and those people do Y things and not Z things”. How debilitating!
There’s so much I could say in this area, it feels like a vast ever expanding frontier. Maybe one other point is how it relates to something like gratitude. If you practise remembering all the things you love about your life, count the good, realise that any imaginary counterfactuals are probably omitting all the things that could we WORSE off in another life…. This can be a great antidote for feelings of fear, anxiety, scarcity, self-pity and so on.

  <p class='blog-para'><span class='blog-question'> - What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</span><br><br>
    Of course the one I am going to pick first: Music..!
    It looks like both from both listening and creating standpoint. Learning an instrument is more challenging later in life but the rewards are immense in terms of slowing down cognitive decline. The more you stick with a new challenge the better you get. It is a great example of what philosopher Kieran Seteya would say is an “atelic” activity, vs a “telic” one (telos being the ultimate goal or purpose of a thing). We are constantly in the mindset of doing something IN ORDER TO, rather than simply IN AND OF ITSELF. Music is its own private island of enjoyment. But if you really wanted to slip back into telic mode and got good enough, you could always record an album or perform a gig ;)<br><br>
    
    
    Another way is learning a new language. Learn a little each day on an app such as Duolingo. It will expand your mind in terms of others cultures and ways of being too. On the subject of apps, you could also invest in a mindfulness meditation app while you’re at it. The science shows paying attention to one's own thoughts while free of judgement, actively practising metacognition, this is great for neuroplasticity too.

    This short pithy video, whilst reading kind of like and advert at the end, I found useful for the learning to ride a bike analogy in particular. Quite a universally relatable 
    example neuroplasticity in action: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWIagHUqD8A">What is Neuroplasticity?</a>

  <h2 class="blog-head">Growth Mindset</h2><br><br>

  <p class='blog-para'><span class='blog-question'> - Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</span><br><br>
    It is contrasted with “fixed mindset” and as the titles allude to, they are concerned with two opposed characteristics: that of the static, unchanging, and that of the flexible and dynamic. 
    <br><br> A growth mindset has a keen eye for opportunity. When a desired result is not forthcoming, it responds with “not yet” as opposed to “no”. It believes in the power to improve, rather than “that’s just the way it is”. It is about process, not just outcome. Rather than seeing some people as possessing some innate talent or desired quality and others not, it says “they simply have worked on that thing for a long time, probably more so than others, but anyone is capable of building it up”.

  <p class='blog-para'><span class='blog-question'> - In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</span><br><br>
    I had previously heard little snippets about ‘growth vs fixed’ via either podcasts or pop psychology and social science books I have read over the years, but it was good to delve deep and get a proper overall understanding of the material.


   <br><br> I think I may have had a misconception about what the “growth” part actually meant. I had negative reservations and assumed it was linked to a cancerous type of capitalistic “growth at all costs” narrative, where you must always be expanding and taking over and dominating and absorbing. But really it’s more closely aligned to a “patience and humility” mindset.

  <p class='blog-para'><span class='blog-question'> - How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</span><br><br>
    I will especially try to remember the growth lessons when confronted with “failure”. It reminds me of the gag off The Simpsons where Lisa goes “did you know the Chinese use the same word for ‘crisis’ as they do for ‘opportunity?’” (which then Homer takes literally and says “YES! ‘Crisitunity!”). If something is not giving a desired result, if the code isn’t working, if I’m having trouble communicating an idea etc, this is unpleasant feeling of unresolvedness is where you can learn a lot. Resist the urge to frame it in terms of SHOULDS,  there is what is, and now it’s just matter of breaking things down and being patient with yourself.  Its like the struggle of physical resistance when exercising. It’s a sign your muscles are having to struggle and grow.

    This one i stumbled upon on youtube I liked because it talked about the topic in relation to coding / software specifically, which is relevant to what we’re doing at Dev Academy:

    As previously mentioned, setbacks become opportunities rather than unwanted sources of headache. Getting stuck can seem like it MUST be frustrating, but there are other options. Like making sure I’m taking appropriate breaks and not feeding in to uncharitable ideas of my own intelligence and capabilities. It takes many repeated times of doing coding to really get the pathways nice and strong and familiar. It takes time to grow. But it is possible, and at a certain point once you’ve completed a certain amount of tasks that you previously couldn’t, you update your identity and how you see yourself accordingly.
