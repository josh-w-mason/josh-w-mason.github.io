      <span class='blog-question'>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</span><br><br>
      I really like making stuff. Having an idea and then being able to realise it is immensely fulfilling and makes you feel very connected and engaged with the work you are 
      doing. For that reason I would prefer working in a small scale team or start up, even though it is inherently less secure and might not offer  the same big bucks that 
      some tech giant might. Also making some specialised or niche software would be cool - like a VST plugin you can use for music production. Or a music production game. If 
      not music then something in the mental health space. Like working for BetterHelp or some other similar company. That might be a few years off though, when starting out I 
      realise you probably can’t be TOO picky.

        <span class='blog-question'>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</span><br><br>
        The main strengths of curiosity and enjoying exploring ideas for myself still holds true. I have done much googling and youtubing in the last several weeks. The downside of 
        getting too distracted with all the content I discover out there I have found can be combated by using things like the time keeping app, that way I can monitor directly 
        how much time I’ve spent on one particular task and measure against the recommended time. 
        </p><br>

      <p class='blog-para'>
      <span class='blog-question'>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</span><br><br>
      Initially it will be getting used to waking up earlier in order to conform to the timetable and to allow for travel time. That can take a few days to adjust. But probably 
      more so it will be trying to not get too overwhelmed due to the higher volume of work. I’m pretty good at managing my time but having that guttural reaction at first that 
      can lead to a sort of self inflicted mild panic can suck. But like all new challenges big and small, break into small more manageable parts and do those one after the other.

      <p class='blog-para'>
      <span class='blog-question'>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span><br><br>
      Well, I’ve never considered myself as a leadership kind of person, so that would be a good skill to develop. I’m confident enough, but maybe the idea of being responsible 
      for others is daunting. Cause that involves having to tell people off sometimes or provide criticism and those things make me squeamish, hah. I’m affable and have good 
      humour so can build rapport easily enough. But yeah confidence in myself and abilities would be an area I can improve in.
      </p><br>

      <p class='blog-para'>
      <span class='blog-question'>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</span><br><br>
      These are basically the same as when I last considered the question:  that if I am feeling lost or stuck with the technical stuff, that someone will be able to help in a 
      friendly and reasonably timely manner. From the core side just that I have people who make me feel open enough to share whatever I feel is needed.
      </p><br>

      <p class='blog-para'>
      <span class='blog-question'>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</span><br><br>
      I will make sure that if I have assignments that give an expected time frame, that this lines up with my time keeping app, and then if I’m straying too far over send messages 
      to the appropriate online channel (this might be Slack instead of Discord now). I’ll pitch it to one that hopefully contains peers and facilitators, so that if its a solution 
      another student has recently stumbled upon, they can offer some constructive feedback. I’ll treat people with good faith, patience and compassion and not be derisive or 
      dismissive, being thoughtful whenever giving feedback.

      <h2 class="blog-head">Learning Plan - Foundations</h2>
      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</span><br><br>

      So at this stage I am still working out all the different possible pathways that one could traverse in tech/software development. I’m sure all the possibilities will become more apparent as I get

      more experience in the field. But so far some things that spring to mind are:<br>
      
      <!-- make into a list-->
     <ul class="blog-para">
      <li>Web design front end</li>
      <li>Web dev back end</li>
      <li>Data Security</li>
      <li>AI tools??? (this one I would imagine would require serious IQ)</li>
      <li>Video game dev</li>
      <li>Some other kind of specialised software dev (like working on something hardcore like a Photoshop type program etc)</li>
      <li>Making a phone app that provides some specific service (e.g Uber Eats / dating apps, that kinda thing)</li>
      </ul></p><br>
      
      <p class="blog-para">With respect to my own interests and background I've kind of narrowed it down to the following areas...<br><br>
      
       - Utilize all my previous experience and knowledge of music. I work a looooot with music software, so I could work for a company that makes either plugins or a Digital Audio 
      Workstation. Or design an app that makes learning about music fun, in a similar way that Duolingo does for language. Or design a program that auto generates film/video game 
      trailer music, since they LITERALLY ALL USE THE EXACT SAME COOKIE CUTTER HANS ZIMMER RIP-oFF TAIKO DRUMS + EPIC STRINGS formula. That would be funny as sort of a satire project.
      Or on a more serious note, something to do with music therapy. Which dovetails into the next area of interest…<br><br>
      
       - Work for an org within the mental health space. Not only is mental health becoming more of a growing concern in the public sphere (some argue that tech, specfically social
       media, actually is exacerbating rates of depression and anxiety), but from personal anecdotal experience I have lost 
      a few people to depression. So doing web dev for somewhere such as thevoicesofhope.org (I have actually written for their blog previously) I think would fill me with a sense
       of meaning and altruism, or like I’m contributing some positive good to society. Perhaps developing a tool that teaches CBT to young people. Or other mental health education resources.<br><br>
      
       - Final option is more morally questionable, but it would be to design an app that tries to suck in as much attention and therefore ad revenue as possible, perhaps a 
       hybrid of all the most addictive parts of things like TikTok, Instagram, Tinder, Youtube… in to order to ride the current wave of blitzscaling to make a quick buck. Then 
       when I have what’s crudely referred to as “f*ck-you money”, I can divert all my time and effort to whatever takes my interest and that I feel is most beneficial. Hopefully then I could put some of the 
       Effective Altruism theory I’ve learned into practise.<br><br>
      
      Considering option 3 usually contributes to the overall anxiety, neuroticism, bad faith and frustration of mankind, it kinda directly contradicts the first two. Not to mention it would
      be gigantic amounts of work towards something with no guarantee of success but which if it DID massively succeed would probably make me feel guilty anyway, hah. So after all's said
      and done ultimately one of the first two areas.</p><br>
      
      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</span><br><br>
      
      Often strengths and limitations tend to be flipsides of the same coin. I think one of my big strengths, which is a trait I’ve had since I can remember, is being an enthusiastic 
      auto-didact - I am totally comfortable going out of my way to find out new things and trying stuff out to see what happens. I love learning by doing, i.e “what does this button 
      do?” and getting feedback in real time. I'm big on praxis. The limitation of this is that I can sometimes go down rabbit holes or get overly fixated on trying to solve some minor
       problem to the detriment of all else. Sometimes I need to remind myself of the bigger picture, or else take a break and refresh my mind. This is essentially an offshoot of 
       perfectionism. Occasionally I can get a bit of imposter syndrome too, and forget to remind myself to be proud of what i DO know or have already accomplished.</p><br>
      
      <p class="blog-para"><span class="blog-question">3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span><br><br>
      
      I am already fairly sociable and funny/affable around people I already know well, but sometimes it can take me a little while to open up and just be myself around totally new people.
      The period of being reserved while I am gaining familiarity is probably longer than it needs to be half the time. Dev Academy is a great chance to be more open with more people.</p><br>
      
      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br>
      - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives<br>
      - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</span><br><br>
      
      When working collaboratively I think it’s important to ensure you give others space and be a good listener. And be transparent with what you are up to and where you’re at, 
      too. Don’t talk over others, criticize arbitrarily or non constructively, it’s important to be open minded. Ask questions if something initially seems weird or confusing. 
      From a personal standpoint, managing my time means macro and micro - what needs to be done by the end of the sprint? How many hours per day? How am I tracking for each 
      specific task? Keep to a regular schedule, but one that has a bit of give and take (for example, it’s good to get in fresh air or a walk in every day, but when you do this 
      can change depending on weather). Also, BEWARE THE PLANNING FALLACY. Always add 10+% to your estimate for when things inevitably go a bit off course, or when there are tech 
      difficulties. Accumulate a bit of surplus productivity capital at the start of the week, so that if I'm feeling unwell or something comes up I have a bit of runway I can use and 
      not panic too much. <br><br>
      
      When things feel like they are getting to me, take a small break. Listen to some comforting music or chill ASMR. Do some mindfulness on the Waking Up app. Play guitar / piano 
      to get brain in different mode. Eat something! Drink some water. Walk around the block. If its a major situation and these aren’t working, reach out to the EDA staff and explain 
      where I’m at.</p><br>
      
      
      
      <p class="blog-para"><span class="blog-question">5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</span><br><br>
      
      So this will be similar to how I’ve been doing this already, based on EDA guidelines. I'll attempt to diagnose the problem on your own first via Dr Google and Youtube, then if I’m
       still stuck after 15/20 mins or so seek help from the relevant discord channel or facilitator. Because there is so much material to cover in the course I will make sure I check my ego at the door
        and not be all like “I 
      can do this all by myself!” and waste like 7 hours reading irrelevant user manuals.</p><br> 
      
      
      
      <p class="blog-para"><span class="blog-question">6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</span><br><br>
      
      I’ll expect them to also respond in a timely manner for similar reasons, i.e seeing as there will usually be lots of stuff to do and I don’t want to get stuck on some hurdle 
      that eats into the time I’ve planned and fall behind. But also respond in a friendly manner, not “lol how’d you get stuck on something so simple”. Not that there would be any chance of that 
      mind you, seeing at everyone at Dev Academy is super lovely!</pr><br>
      
      
      
      
      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's 
        important to plan these in.</span><br><br>
      
      Thursday evenings I usually get in some socialising time out of the house (alternates between Art Hack meet up group and quiz night). I don’t really have any other hard 
      commitments locked in, but I do like to make time to practise music every day (either playing an instrument or composing on computer). I was going to start a weekly Twitch 
      stream too for promo purposes but I may wait until Dev is over so that I can fully commit.<br><br>
