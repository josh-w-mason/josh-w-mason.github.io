    <span class='blog-question'>1. A time I was blocked on a simple problem</span><br><br>
	  What was the problem? <br><br>

    We’ll use an example from recent memory and take one of the Javascript katas we were just working on. Seeing as my friend is not technical savvy, 
    I’ll try explain the jargon as I go. For the challenge, we had to write a piece of code that would go a few layers deep within a pre defined piece 
    of data that contained a series of numbers, and update that list with a given number. I’ll assume this counts as “simple” (maybe not for the lay 
    person but for any web developer worth their salt I’m guessing simple)
  </p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    What problem-solving techniques did you use?<br><br>
   
    Break down the problem. What is really being asked here? Write a checklist of steps. Be very precise about what is required for each step. 
    Consult youtube tutorials on similar problems. Look up internet articles detailing explanations of specific pieces of code I could use. Take 
    a break, switch up my mind with a different activity. Play some music. Go on the discord server to see if my peers got stuck in a similar fashion 
    and posed any questions about it. Send a screenshot to one of my group chats that has 2 developer friends in it, who were able to provide a hint 
    in the right direction.

    How did you feel throughout the process?<br><br>
    Determined. Then frustrated. More frustrated. Then convinced the solution MUST be not far away. Curious. Determined again. What have I missed? 
    What am I not seeing? It must be here SOMEWHERE. Anxious. This is taking too long. What if I CAN’T figure it out? Fear. “There’s no shame in having 
    someone more experienced and knowledgeable spoon feed me clues”. Feeling the mental burn. Remember it’s all part of the process. Feel better.

    What did you learn?<br><br>

    In this specific case, I was being tripped up by having my code try to do too much at once AND I was using the wrong notation. So I learned sometimes 
    I need to be clearer, less convoluted. And leave NO stone unturned. Question everything down to the specific position of a specific type of bracket 
    somewhere etc.  Don’t assume two different types of notation work EXACTLY the same. Assumptions will be useful sometimes but definitely slow you down other times.

    <span class='blog-question'>2. elegantly solved a problem.</span><br><br>
	  
    What was the problem?<br><br>
    For this example we will go further back in time, to a solution I’m really proud of and was fairly formative. I was 17, final year of high school, 2007. My 
    school was a bit weird and one of the projects we got assigned for our final year was to be one of our own choosing, that we would work on for the whole year, 
    on top of our usual school work. We had a sponsor that was one of the faculty who we had meetings with every month or so to see how we were tracking.<br><br>
    For my project I choose to make a 7 track EP of my own music. Compose all the songs, perform all the parts, do some basic mixing, make the artwork, take it to 
    a printing place who would make like 100 copies. About halfway through all this my tech crashed and I lost most of what I had been working on up until that point.

  </p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    What problem-solving techniques did you use?<br><br>
    Check online. Google everything. Look everywhere on my computer. Ask people I knew who knew about music making software what I could do. Triple check all my external 
    hardware for backups. Go for a big walk. Refresh. Regain composure. Leave it for a few days, think about other things.<br><br> 


   Once I had decided that I was at the point where I was better off to begin almost from scratch again and reconstruct the songs from memory, I accepted my fate and did 
   that. You learn to renegotiate things when it comes to deadlines.

  </p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    How did you feel throughout the process?<br><br>

    Panicked and angry. Scared. Disappointed. Frustrated. Then eventually, forgiveness of myself. Then optimistic.

  </p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    What did you learn?<br><br>

    ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR STUFF…!!!<br><br>

    With art there’s a lamentation that what has been lost can never be recaptured EXACTLY the way it was before. There are too many variables that interplay with one 
    another, which would all need to be exactly the same again. I suppose technically if you had perfect memory you could do that. But different doesn’t always mean bad. 
    Sure, no two works are the same, but they are special and good in their own unique ways.

</p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    Pseudocode: Quite confident. Writing this out when beginning a new coding challenge is becoming second nature, it grounds the whole process and gives a nice 
    familiar feeling starting place. It’s a great way of starting simplified.
	
  </p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    
    Trying something: Very comfortable. I am a big believer in “what happens if I do x”. The worst that can happen is that it just doesn’t work, and you can always 
    go back and try something else. This is of course different from say, in the real world being like “let’s see what happens if I try ski down this slope that is 
    ranked extreme difficulty”.  The level of physical risk is vastly disproportionate to any perceived potential gain. Play around if you have the option to in low 
    risk environments first.
	
  </p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    Rubber ducky method: I haven’t tried this one as of yet. Maybe because the idea of talking out loud to an inanimate object makes me feel weird haha. And like, futile 
    or something, since it can’t respond, even though I know thats not the point and it’s more in the act of explanation that you make a discovery. I think I prefer 
    for that reason to explain the problem to a javascript savvy friend, it provides a similar function in that respect. 
	
  </p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    Reading error messages: Googling specific messages in a specific context is invaluable! People may have already solved your exact problem before. Actually it’s 
    probably more like 9 out of 10 times they have. We all stand on the shoulders of giants. Don’t be too proud and spend unnecessary time reinventing the wheel.
	
  </p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    Console.logging: I would be utterly screwed if I wasn’t able to do this approximately once every 20 seconds. Truly indispensable, seeing as it tells the computer 
    to show you what it’s doing.
	
  </p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    Googling: Unless I am fairly confident with the problem and it’s a relatively simple one, most challenges will start off with some googling or youtubing. Usually
	
  </p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    Asking your peers for help: I’m usually fine with this, although I am aware that they will be concerned with their own time, and the response may not be instantaneous. 
    I usually will ask peers if I have already exhausted other options, and I am about to take a break anyway, so this gives some time for them to respond.
     
  </p><br>

  <p class='blog-para'>
    Asking coaches for help: Some similar reflections as to with my response for peers, although I know coaches are paid specifically to be there for help so there wouldn’t 
    be the whole “oh I don’t want to take up too much of their time” thought going in the background. The problem with asking actual people directly is that they have the 
    option of going you the exact right answer (same with chatGPT AI tool) and you really don’t want to do that unless you have basically got it 95% right already and need 
    to move on due to time constraints. The most important thing is how you personally relate to information in your own understanding, and for that you need to put in the 
    mahi of experimenting and trying and failing. Of course there is a pride aspect too: it’s very satisfying struggling and then finding the right answer all by yourself. 
    It makes you feel smart. But you shouldn’t get too hung up on needing to feel smart to the detriment of all else. Again, deadlines.

  <p class='blog-para'>
    Improving your process with reflection: I may have mentioned my opinion on writing in a previous reflection exercise, but I think it is a very valuable tool in working 
    out what you actually think. It allows for a lot less vague or fuzzy thinking. But also good for strengthening those neural connections. And like in the rubber ducky method, 
    the act of explaining to the page can help shed light on things you previously may not have considered.<br><br>
