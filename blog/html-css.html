Today we are going to tackle the age old Dev Academy question that may have stumped many a student for at least a few hours:<br><br>

<em>&emsp; - What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</em> <br><br>

Every html file outlines the content for your web page and is made up of a series of different 
components, which are known as elements. There are many different kinds of elements, and they 
are denoted using tags. For example, if you wanted to write a regular ol’ paragraph such as 
“The quick brown fox jumps…etc”, you would use the ‘p’ (&lt;p&gt;) tag. Written as code this looks like:<br><br></p>

<p class="techparagraph">Looks pretty straight forward, right? What you may not have realised is that this paragraph has 
  some built in properties that dictate how it will be laid out on the page. It may look like there
   is empty space beside it on our web page, but this is more akin to air rather than a perfect 
   vacuum: it’s still there, you just can’t see it. To demonstrate, watch how even if I place two 
   paragraphs side by side in Visual Studio Code, this is not how they are displayed on our page:<br><br></p>

<p class="techparagraph">You know how on those detective TV shows they go into a seemingly innocuous hotel room, but then turn
   on a UV light and all of a sudden the room lights up with previously washed out blood stains, making it
   resemble a Jackson Pollock painting? I will now do the web dev equivalent of that, and tell
    the html to display the paragraph outline, by specifying this property in the linked CSS code:<br><br></p>

<p class="techparagraph">P elements are a type of “block” element, which means they always take up the whole line even if your
   text didn’t take up the whole line. As an internal logic this makes sense, because in real life we 
   know that new paragraphs always start on a new line. But sometimes we don’t want to start on an 
   entirely new line - for example, if we want to add an element such as a “span” that affects only 
   a portion of the words in the middle of a sentence. We wouldn’t want this to move the rest of the
    sentence to the next line. Fortunately, these elements have a different built-in display property known 
    as “inline”, whereby they will play nice and only take up as much space as needed and will automatically 
    fit beside one another. If I want my paragraph to behave in such a way, 
    I can manually define the display property as inline like so:<br><br></p>

<p class="techparagraph">One thing to bare in mind however, is that when you specify inline as the display, if you try to 
change the width and height, these parameters will have no effect. Presumably because
 under the hood  these properties are in flux and adjust automatically depending on the context of all the elements that they have to fit 
 together with. One way to get around this though is by using the display property “inline-block”, which 
 is sort of the best of both worlds, in that it shares space on a single line AND 
 you can also set the height and width properties.<br><br></p>

<p class="techparagraph">As an example, see the above. It is still fitting the two separate p elements on one line, and 
I have told the CSS styling code on the right to make the last half of the sentence a bigger font-size. <br><br>
