    <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">What is Emotional Intelligence?</span><br><br>
    Emotional intelligence is a series of different cognitive tools that are crucial for helping us successfully navigate the social 
    world around us. Commonly it is broken down into four domains:</p>
    <ul class="blog-para">
      <li>self awareness</li>
    <li>self management</li>
    <li>social awareness</li>
    <li>relationship management</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="blog-para">To me I see it as knowledge about both the objective emotional stuff (fields like psychology, neuroscience, some philosophy) and 
    the subjective phenomenology (noticing how you feel, recognizing patterns, noticing how others are feeling by the external physical
     clues they give etc). Understanding things that cause visceral reactions for you, being deliberate and considerate when you speak, 
     being able to accommodate the needs and feelings of others.</p><br>

    <p class="blog-para"><span class="blog-question">How is EQ different to IQ?</span><br><br>
    IQ is more traditionally associated with hard science, STEM type areas. You can easily have IQ without EQ, in fact, that’s basically
     the entire premise for the TV Show the Big Bang Theory. I’m trying to think what high EQ but low IQ looks like now…. Perhaps 
     someone who you would say has “street smarts”. Absolutely fun to have a drink with and yarn for hours, funny and smiles a lot, 
     but can’t parallel park and has a hard time with deadlines. It’s interesting now that I think about it because in my mind EQ 
     necessarily incorporates at least a little bit of IQ, but the vice versa I don’t think is true. I think this is due to the 
     ubiquity of the environment. EQ is applicable everywhere, whereas what we typically consider high IQ areas (quantum mechanics or 
     something) is very niche in scope.</p><br>
    <p class="blog-para"><span class="blog-question"> Why is EQ important?</span><br><br>
    Because as much as we care about thinking abstractly and making models about the future, if we don’t ground it in care for human 
    flourishing then it is all moot . It’s that classic Jurassic Park Jeff Goldblum line “we were so busy wondering whether we could 
    we never stopped to think whether we should”. Intelligence and cleverness for their own sake can give you bio weapons. Like yeah 
    you proved you can pull off some super complicated feat of DNA splicing and flexed your technical prowess. But now you have 
    something that if not handled extremely carefully can kill millions of innocent people. IQ in isolation is just hubris. But also, 
    if someone thinks that learning how to make their own life more fulfilling and to do the same for others, on a planet with 8 
    billion other people is unimportant then I almost don’t know what to say to them, haha. I would need to think very long and hard 
    about what chain of cold logic I could present to them to convince them of that one.</p>
