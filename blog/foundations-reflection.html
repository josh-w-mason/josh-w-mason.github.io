    <span class='blog-question'> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</span><br><br>
    (1) The line between perseverance and ego can become a bit blurred. “Wow look at me go, I’m still chipping away at this problem, I refuse to give up!”. Ok, but now you are over time 
    budget, and that addiction to the feeling of being intellectually validated may have blinded you from consulting others and moving on to the next task in a more timely and 
    efficient manner. The best solution is usually always a compromise: you are stronger if you practice exploring your own thoughts AND seeking those of others.<br><br>

    (2) That while some people’s pre established personalities may mean that they pick up certain disciplines or skills quicker, fundamentally it is possible with repeated 
    effort to basically do anything. There is no such thing a naturally artistic or programmer or engineer or fitness type person, you just practise and become those things.<br><br>

    (3) That I already have some good habits that are valued in a coding environment, such as the mindfulness meditation practise and going outside and getting fresh air. I found
     it very rewarding looking into the mindfulness stuff because as I previously mentioned I’ve logged many a minute in the Waking Up app and it’s something I’m already really
      interested in, so to be able to share in this curiosity is great.

    <span class='blog-question'> What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</span><br><br>
    Programming shares a fundamental universal trait with essentially every single area of human activity, namely, it has a social dimension. You interact and have to collaborate 
    with others. Without self awareness and empathy this becomes EXTREMELY difficult, if not impossible. When in an individual setting, say learning or going off to code by 
    yourself for a while, you still need to exercise empathy and kindness etc TOWARDS YOURSELF. The golden rule is “do unto others as you would have them do unto you”  
    but perhaps the ‘neurotic-21st-century-terminally-online-zoomer’ amendment should be “...and think unto yourself how you do unto others”. Essentially compassion without 
    double standards.<br><br>

    Values are just like having a moral compass. When given the opportunity “hey can you write a piece of code that steels a bunch of elderly people’s credit card information?” 
    your values should kick in and make you refuse, rather than be like “well let’s test my intelligence and see if I can pull that off”.

    <span class='blog-question'> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</span><br><br>
    I suppose this is kind of meta but just the mere fact of covering these topics in the course in the first place. It’s stuff I’m naturally interested in, being an avid 
    consumer of pop psychology, sociology, philosophy etc (mostly in the form of podcasts and youtube vids), but I assumed I would check all that soft stuff  in at the door 
    and put on my “big brain abstract mathematical thinking” hat instead. But it was a welcome and very refreshing counterbalance to all that stuff, sort of grounding it in a way.

  <p class='blog-para'>
    <span class='blog-question'> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</span><br><br>
    As previously said, I feel like I have some experience in the humanities type realm, the more reflective and feelings type subjects. Perhaps in the Dev Academy context 
    it’s finding the most poignant things to say, out of the primordial soup of ideas in my head. Like, is there an even more insightful point or connection I could make here 
    that isn’t occurring to me? That type of thing. It’s the problem of curation and distillation as opposed to not knowing what to say at all.

  <p class='blog-para'>
    <span class='blog-question'> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</span><br><br>
    I think this quote from the EDA handbook just a few lines above sums it up nicely:<br>
    “Tech employers aren't looking for top grades or the person with the most outstanding code. They're looking for exceptional human beings who will enhance the culture of their team.”<br>
    The purpose of the course (or ‘telos’ if I’m putting my pretentious philosophy hat back on) is to get you a job in the tech sector. While knowing the tools of the trade is 
    necessary, it’s also not the whole picture. Being someone who is easy to get along with, reliable, who’s open to feedback and willing to engage and learn is what makes people
     want to work with you.

  <p class='blog-para'>
    <span class='blog-question'> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? 
      Justify your answer.</span><br><br>
      No, I think the ratio of tech to core is pretty well adjusted and the two different sections complement each other nicely. Sometimes the tech can be quite challenging so 
      having those core resources to fallback on is a big help.<br><br>
