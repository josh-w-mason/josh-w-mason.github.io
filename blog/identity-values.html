      <span class="blog-question">1. Using a tool to help you identify and name the values most important to you </span><br><br>

      I have used both the Big 5 personality test and the "AllRight" Strengths finder. The most salient values that keep cropping up are: creativity, kindness and 
      openmindedness.</p><br>
      

      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">2. Stories of how these values were demonstrated in practice </span><br><br>
      Creativity:
      Many musical examples including finishing a Drum & Bass EP started during lockdown. Making my own accompanying artwork using digital and analogue mediums,  filtering the image through a friend’s lawn chair using a projector and recapturing the image.
      Also I came up an idea for a children’s book for a friend who was having a baby. I worked on the prose with a friend, and did all the artwork myself. It’s called ‘The Tuatara and the Weka’’ (essentially a reimagined Tortoise and the Hare story in Aotearoa).
       Unfortunately only a handful of copies were printed so you can’t go to any major bookstores to read it yourself but I can assure you it exists.<br><br>
      Kindness: when a friend was going through some psychological and other health issues recently I drove in to town to check up on her in the hotel she was temporarily staying at, 
      making sure she was ok, then went out and bought groceries and other supplies for her. Also I 
      helped another friend who didn’t have a vehicle move house recently (though in my mind pretty standard friend behaviour).<br><br>
      Openmindedness: I’ve travelled to Salvador in Brazil to hang out with a friend (who was flying in from Italy) and see a part of the world I normally wouldn't. Not too many 
      people can say that. I also traveled to Miami on a separate occassion to go on a cruise ship that featured about 40 heavy metal bands. I've been learning Spanish on Duolingo. 
      I have quite a varied work history too. One time I drove all the way to Mangawhai (about a couple hours north of Auckland) to work a second temp job doing hospo for a festival on 
      new years.</p><br>

      <p class="blog-para">From Jesse:<br>
      "Thought I'd message you privately re strengths and weaknesses bro. I reckon you could actually use the example of getting into the Dev Academy as both a strength and a 
      weakness. You persisted after not getting in what, twice? You showed resilience and determination (which paid off). However you also shared that if you didn't eventually get 
      in that it would probably crush you and head you in a downward spiral. That state of mind could cause you alot of unnecessary pain. I know shits not easy but letting yourself 
      go down that path is your weakness I reckon (ie not believing in yourself and your abilities)"</p>
     
       <p class="blog-para"> ^^ Reflecting on Jesse's comment a little. It wasn't simply a matter of "I applied for a thing that I wanted, and now that 
        I didn't get it I'm depressed", more that it contributed to a concatonation of different things that were going on in my life that engendered a feeling of 
        like, directionlessness. Perhaps me writing this now is like trying to do PR retroactively to make me seem more resilient. But I'd like to think it's kind of an obvious truth 
        that in life if one thing doesnt work 
        out, you just come up with something new and try that and keep going. Side note, I think showing vulnerability and allowing yourself to reflect for a certain
      period of time (note: NOT indefinitely) can be cathartic, plus lead to character strengthening in like a Nassim Taleb "anti-fragility" type way... but that's a larger psychological discussion
    for another blog. </p><br>

      <p class="blog-para">I was going back and forth on whether to share this final testimonial, but it is an excerpt from a very significant part of my journey that has probably shaped me the most.<br>
      Here's some words from a letter written to me by a long term partner just before she passed away:<br>
      “...you were the funniest, kindest, most loving + caring person ever. I hope you know that absolutely. Please have more confidence in yourself - 
      who you are and the way you look is perfect”</p><br>
      
      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">4. An achievement you are proud of</span> <br> <br>
      Putting my own music on Spotify. Actually finishing something after countless hours tinkering, refining, learning, self-doubt, growth, more revision…. 
      To have a tangible digital product at the end that I can actually share with people is very rewarding.</p><br>
      
      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">5. Visuals or narratives that help you describe where your values came from </span><br><br>

      I don't have any particular ones on hand, but if you google image search "Kapiti Island as seen from Paekakariki" this will give you my view from 
    home for the formative period circa 1997 - 2007, neatly almost coinciding with the school years of my life (which was more like 1995 - 2007). Definitely my
  appreciation of nature was forged by this, plus going to 2 Steiner schools definitely contributed too.</p><br>
      
      
      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">6. Whakataukī (proverbs) or quotes that sum up your values</span><br><br>

      I don’t have particular nice and short quotes that sum up my values explicitly, really. Recently I have been listening to author David Foster Wallace’s 2005 commencement speech “This is Water” on 
      a monthly basis. This part of the speech in particular really distills a lot of my thoughts around intellectual complaceny, and concerns about 21st Century technologically advanced Western disconnectedness:<br><br>
      
      "…The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship–be it JC or Allah, 
      be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles–is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat. You. Alive.<br><br> 
      If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. 
      Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they 
      finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It’s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. 
      The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.<br><br>
      
      Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as 
      smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they’re evil or 
      sinful, it’s that they’re unconscious. They are default settings.<br><br>
      
      
      They’re the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever 
      being fully aware that that’s what you’re doing. And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called 
      real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed 
      these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the 
      centre of all creation.”</p><br>
      
      
      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">7. Your review of learning</span><br><br>
        After going through the course material so far this has given me a greater appreciation for the benefit of writing after passively ingesting new information.
        The act of putting thoughts into words on a page kinda crystalizes and reinforces them, which greatly helps memory and to clarify.

      <p class="blog-para"><span class="blog-question">Part 2 <br><br>


      1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on
       the decision now.</span><br><br>
      
      When I left a band in late 2011 that I had been playing in for over three years. I had to weigh up the interests of the group vs my own. They were all really 
      great people, I loved the music and did have a great time playing shows across the country, but ultimately I was wanting to devote more time to exploring
      and creating my own music, which was a radically different genre. That plus some of the people in the scene the band would occassionally hang out with 
      would rub me the wrong way, in quite an explicit clash of values (extreme pessimism plus some proto fascism sprinkled in there). The group was able to replace 
      me fairly easily and we all stayed on good terms, and even though creatively I was more on my own going forward, I felt this to be more liberating and ended 
      up being happier and learning a lot more.

      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity </span> <br><br>

      As a quick aside, I find it tricky being very specific about identity - like if the answer is supposed to be "I identify as [x, y, z groups/isms/labels]"
      I'm not usually sure how to answer. Categories such as gender, ethnicity, religion etc don't really hold much sway for me,  or I've not felt the pull to conform to the
      stereotypes of any of these classes anyway (cue Humanities' professors going 
      "aha - of course you don't notice the privilege-water you are swimming in!" to which I would reply "we don't have time to get into that stuff in a Dev Academy post")
      )
      The long ish version: I’m one of those ahistorical millennials growing up in the era of newly and unprecedentedly unleashed First World secular capitalist anomie, on the cusp of the internet age. My mother was 
      (and kinda still is) of the Ba’hai faith, which has a core acceptance of all the worlds religions. Dad is Apatheist at best. Middle class, white, gratuitously compassionate and hippie-adjacent. 
      Great respect for music, the arts and the 
      numinous in general, rather than through the lens of any particular intellectual tradition. Curious about the human condition. My peers, aka the people that stuck around me and ended up 
      becoming my friend group are all very intellectual,
       generous, funny, liberal types. They are people who I can absolutely depend on in a crisis, and will turn to 
       sometimes when I have big questions or want general advice. They reinforce my sense of optimism and like to have fun, and indulge my creativity and playfulness.</p><br>  
      
      
      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey </span><br><br>

      As previously mentioned, very creative so good at coming up with original ideas for projects  and I get along with new people real easily, can listen and don’t need to be 
      the center of attention or anything insecure like that.</p><br>
      
      
      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</span><br><br>

      Sometimes I can get excited about the generating new ideas part it can be tricky staying focused and seeing one thing through to the end. The idealistic part of 
      me has sometimes meant Im always just focussing on whatever music or art I’m working on at home without giving much thought to my job or challenging myself, so I’ve tended 
      to have more or less customer service or entry level positions at a few different places, and moved around quite a lot. I’ve become more aware of this lately and that’s why 
      I’ve thought about what I could do that I could stay in that would continuously challenge me and where I can always count on there being more to learn.</p><br>
      
      
      <p class="blog-para"> <span class="blog-question">5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective
         they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why</span><br><br>

      In a previous job, one particular co-worker would give myself and the other new-ish person there a hard time whenever we were working on tasks. This 
      one particular task involved driving up and down the rows cutting out the dead plants and I think I may have missed 
      the odd one, or the other newbie missed one; it was hard to know for sure while working on different areas at the same time. Anyway, this guy who had been there a while and 
      thought he could basically talk to people however he wanted kept yelling and threatening us saying the boss would fire us etc (it was actually a pretty 
      toxic system because it seemed like there was vicarious responsibility, so it was probably more him getting mad because it may reflect badly on him). 
      I just calmly said something like “hey I don’t know for sure if I’m the one 
      responsible, but I hear you and I can always go back and double check if it’s an issue. I’ll be as vigilant as I can but still its possible some might slip through
       the cracks 
      seeing as I’m still a newbie”. <br><br>
      
      To be honest he didn’t really care or acknowledge what I said, and ultimately he was one of the reasons I ended up 
      leaving the company slightly earlier than planned. If I had to stay and ended up in a similar situation again, I would be more assertive and say “first of all I don't appreciate
      being spoken to like 
      that, and it’s not helping the situation”. Then if it continued I would explain the situation to the higher ups and see if they would have a word. Hopefully an understanding
    is reached, or compromise (e.g we might just not work well together, and therefore get put on different tasks going forward). If THAT'S not possible and work is just constant
  mental anguish I would probably still leave. Generally speaking, not much is worth sacrificing your long-term mental wellbeing for.</pr>
